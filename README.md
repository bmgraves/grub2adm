# Description
grub2adm is intended to be a single script that simplifies and streamlines the usage and administration of grub2.
When dealing with grub2 currently there are several different commands that must be used, and a few things involved
in the use of grub2 are not readily apparent. It is the intention of this project to allow users to manage their
grub2 boot options in a simple and pain free way.

NOTE: Latest Roadmap Will always be listed under the "alpha" branch. To check feature status, please look under that
      readme.

# STATUS
Current version is limited, but ready for use. Master version is currently the beta version, New features
will be tested and developed on the alpha version, before being pushed up for usage tests.

# Installation and usage
With elevated privledges run the "install.sh" script, this will install all the necessary files.
the default install location for the command is "/usr/sbin" this is changable within the install.sh script.

Currently there are a few working features that can be used:

grub2adm list - Lists all the currently known boot options.
grub2adm set-default - This can be used with either a "string" value, or a numerical value as found in the "list" option.
grub2adm user list - Lists all the users in the config files.
