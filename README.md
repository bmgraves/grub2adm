# Description
grub2adm is intended to be a single script that simplifies and streamlines the usage and administration of grub2.
When dealing with grub2 currently there are several different commands that must be used, and a few things involved
in the use of grub2 are not readily apparent. It is the intention of this program to allow users to manage their
grub2 boot options in a simple and pain free way.


# Roadmap
- (COMPLETE) Get working Argument parsing.                 
- (IN-PROGRESS) List available boot options in intelligent way.
- (PENDING) Ability to set-default boot options
- (PENDING) Future Options go here.
